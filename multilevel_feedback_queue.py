"""
Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler.
In an MLFQ, tasks can move between multiple levels of queues based on their behavior, 
such as time spent in a queue or whether they complete their burst time allocation.

- Tasks are organized into multiple levels of queues. High-priority tasks start 
in the highest-priority queue (Queue 0) and are demoted to lower-priority queues 
if they are not completed within the allocated time quantum.

- Each queue has a unique time quantum (queue_quanta), which determines the 
total amount of time the scheduler allocates to tasks in that queue during one pass.

- Tasks are initially placed in the highest-priority queue. If a task isnâ€™t completed within its allocated time, it is moved to a lower-priority queue.
Tasks in lower-priority queues receive larger time quanta, reflecting their reduced priority.
